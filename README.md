# Simon Game 

### Game to train your working memory. Built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and little bit of JQuery.

### How this works?
This is a simple program where the tiles light up in a sequence and you have to  repeat the sequence.
As you level up the sequence gets more and more complex. I personally made it to level 9, see if you can break my record:)

##### Note: Game only works on desktop, the code isn't tailored for mobile devices.

Happy coding:)
